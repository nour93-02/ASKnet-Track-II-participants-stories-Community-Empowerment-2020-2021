My name is Nour I was born and raised in Dubai for eleven years then wentback to Egypt where I am originally from. However, I lived most of my adult life in Cairo. I studied Media design in the German University in Cairo where I majored in Media design. After graduating I was intrigued to broaden my knowledge and experience. So, I worked as an Account Manager in AXEER Studio; a production and creative agency located in the heart of Cairo, Egypt the agency specialises in creating and promoting value based content and expressing stories that matter, stories of people with no voices. During my time there I experienced and witnessed the true oppression and the harsh circumstances of the egyptian people. I also had the privilege working with clients and international organisations such as the UNICEF, UNWomen, P&G, IOM, and EU...Etc. But as the conflict grew more and more in the Middle East, life began to get harder and harder by the minute, so she took a leap of faith and left to Germany for a new, better life circumstances. Now, she lives and works in Berlin as a photographer, videographer and media coordinator at r0g agency for open culture and critical transformation.
